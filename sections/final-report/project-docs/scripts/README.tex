# Scripts

This directory includes scripts used for development that didn't really fit with a specific part of a project **or** had multiple purposes.

The scripts are exclusively written in Bash and focus on operatics.

The `ci` directory includes scripts intended for Continuous Integration.
If you are interested in how a component is used, see if it has a script associated with that.

The CI system we intended to use heavily was TravisCI.
Most of the `ci` scripts do not get used except for the one that builds the software (`transformer.sh`).
That said most of the scripts are [mostly] accurate, just not robust enough for an automation build system.
